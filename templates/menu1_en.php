        My name is László Sulyok and I have been making shoes for 
        nearly thirty years. I was born in 1962, graduated in a 
        footwear industry trade school in 1981 and got my license 
        for orthopedic shoemaking in 2003. Apart from traditional 
        hand-sewn shoes, I manufacture orthopedic footwear, riding 
        and dancing boots as well.

        I believe uniqueness to be very important in my work, thus 
        I also design custom-made shoes. Paying attention to tradition 
        and choosing the best materials, I strive to manufacture both 
        ready-made and tailored shoes of various style, shape and colour 
        that are as comfortable, elegant and durable as possible.
